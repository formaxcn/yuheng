# Portion Management & Sharing

YuHeng makes it easy to log meals that are shared with family or friends without needing complex mental math.

## Meal Sharing
When you record a dish that multiple people consumed:
- **Sharing Mode**: Toggle "Meal Sharing" in the Add Meal page.
- **Definition**: Specify the number of people sharing or your exact personal percentage (e.g., "I ate 30% of this dish").
- **Automatic Scaling**: The system automatically calculates the calories and macronutrients for your specific portion while keeping the original dish record intact.

## Smart Weight Scaling
If you have a large dish but only eat part of it, you can simply adjust the "Amount" slider. The AI estimates the *total* dish weight, and you tell the app how much *you* actually ate.

## Accurate Tracking
This feature ensures that your daily totals reflect what you actually consumed, rather than the entire contents of a shared plate or a restaurant serving.
