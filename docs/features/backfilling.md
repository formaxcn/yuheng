# Backfilling Logic

YuHeng allows users to add meals for past dates or specific times.

## Date/Time Selection
Users can pick a date and time in the "Add Meal" page using the backfill toggle.

## Meal Type Classification
The system automatically classifies the meal based on the time:
-   `06:00 - 10:00`: Breakfast
-   `10:00 - 14:00`: Lunch
-   `17:00 - 19:00`: Dinner
-   `Other`: Snack

These thresholds are configurable in the Settings.
