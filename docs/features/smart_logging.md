# Smart Food Logging

YuHeng provides an intelligent way to log your meals using Large Language Models (LLMs). It can transform unstructured text or photos into detailed nutritional entries.

## Photo-Based Logging
The flagship feature of YuHeng:
- **Instant Analysis**: Take a photo of your meal and the AI will identify the dishes and estimate their weights.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uploading a photo triggers a background task. You can keep using the app while the AI analyzes your food.
- **Visual Confirmation**: Once analyzed, the results are displayed for your review before saving.

## Smart Text Addition
You can also log food by typing a simple description:
- "Two eggs and a slice of toast"
- "Large bowl of beef ramen"

The AI parses these descriptions to find matching nutritional profiles.

## Real-Time Adjustments
If the AI makes a mistake (e.g., misidentifying a protein or missing an item), you can:
- **Edit Items**: Manually change the amount or description.
- **AI Refinement**: Provide a text instruction like "The fish is actually salmon" or "Increase the rice amount", and the AI will recalculate the entry based on your feedback.
