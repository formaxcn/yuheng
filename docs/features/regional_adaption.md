# Regional Adaption (CN/US)

YuHeng is a global-ready application that adapts its behavior based on your region. This minimizes the setup effort required for users in different parts of the world.

## One-Click Quick Setup
In the Settings page, you can choose between major regions (e.g., China or United States). Selecting a region automatically updates several preferences:

| Setting | China (CN) | United States (US) |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Weight Unit** | Grams (g) | Ounces (oz) |
| **Energy Unit** | kcal | kcal |
| **Time Format** | 24-hour | 12-hour (AM/PM) |
| **AI Language** | 中文 (Chinese) | English |
| **Nutrition Std** | CN Guidelines | US Guidelines |

## AI Context Awareness
The selected region also provides context to the AI during recognition. For example, it might prioritize local units or food naming conventions common in that region.

## Individual Overrides
Even after selecting a region, you can still customize any specific setting (like units or language) individually to suit your preferences.
