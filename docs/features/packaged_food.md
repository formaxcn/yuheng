# Packaged Food Recognition (OCR)

YuHeng features a specialized recognition mode for packaged foods and drinks. It uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) via AI to read nutrition labels and packaging information.

## How it Works
When you take a photo of a food package or nutrition label:
1. **Targeted Scanning**: The AI looks for product names, brands, and most importantly, the nutrition facts table.
2. **Standardization**: The AI is instructed to prioritize "per 100g/ml" or "per serving" data to ensure consistency.
3. **Weight Extraction**: It automatically extracts the net weight or volume of the product if visible on the packaging.

## Benefits
- **Accuracy**: Directly reads the manufacturer's data instead of estimating based on visual appearance.
- **Convenience**: No need to manually type in nutrition data from the label.
- **Support for Items**: Great for snacks, drinks, and ingredients where visual estimation is difficult.
